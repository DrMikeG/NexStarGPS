NexStarGPS
==========

Uses TinyGPS from http://arduiniana.org/libraries/tinygps/ as GPS provider.

Uses customized versions of SoftwareSerial and SendOnlySoftwareSerial libraries.

Does not use CTS/RTS pins since they are not used on NexStar 5SE.

> CTS/RTS are 2 of the 4 serial pins. They are old school and not used anymore, which is probably why they have been repurposed.

 CTS is always 3V, RTS is always 12V (!). Commonly available 4-wire telephone cables can be used to connect GPS unit to telescope (but you need 6p6c plug on telescope side anyway, just do not connect pins 1 and 6)

**Also 5SE has TX and RX pins shortcutted so relatively weird logic with two software serial instances (one for TX, another for RX) is used to allow telescope firmware to work properly.**

Without the work of Andre Paquette you find at http://www.paquettefamily.ca/nexstar/NexStar_AUX_Commands_10.pdf this library would have been impossible. Andre you rock!

## 23rd May 2020 ##

Back in 2017, I used this library and instructions to make a compatible GPS unit for my celestron 127SLT.
And amazingly, it worked, and I didn't brick my telescope.

However it recently developed a fault, so now I have an opportunity (and a week of annual leave in isolation with the kids) in which I can try again and hopefully do a better job.

I plan to use an esp32 rather than an arduino nano this time - which will hopefully allow me to check the status of the unit via a webpage.

I also plan to use a proper power convertor this time, not something I pulled from a cigarette lighter adaptor.

### Overview of NEO-6M GPS Module ###

NEO-6M GPS Chip
The heart of the module is a NEO-6M GPS chip from u-blox. It can track up to 22 satellites on 50 channels and achieves the industry’s highest level of sensitivity i.e. -161 dB tracking, while consuming only 45mA supply current. The u-blox 6 positioning engine also boasts a Time-To-First-Fix (TTFF) of under 1 second. One of the best features the chip provides is Power Save Mode(PSM). It allows a reduction in system power consumption by selectively switching parts of the receiver ON and OFF. This dramatically reduces power consumption of the module to just 11mA making it suitable for power sensitive applications like GPS wristwatch. The necessary data pins of NEO-6M GPS chip are broken out to a "0.1″ pitch headers. This includes pins required for communication with a microcontroller over UART.

Note:- The module supports baud rate from 4800bps to 230400bps with default baud of 9600.

### Position Fix LED Indicator ###

There is an LED on the NEO-6M GPS Module which indicates the status of Position Fix. It’ll blink at various rates depending on what state it’s in

No Blinking ==> means It is searching for satellites
Blink every 1s – means Position Fix is found

3.3V LDO Regulator
The operating voltage of the NEO-6M chip is from 2.7 to 3.6V. But, the module comes with MIC5205 ultra-low dropout 3V3 regulator from MICREL. The logic pins are also 5-volt tolerant, so we can easily connect it to an Arduino or any 5V logic microcontroller without using any logic level converter.

![Alt text](./README_img/gps2.jpg)

Battery & EEPROM

The module is equipped with an HK24C32 two wire serial EEPROM. It is 4KB in size and connected to the NEO-6M chip via I2C.The module also contains a rechargeable button battery which acts as a super-capacitor.

An EEPROM together with battery helps retain the battery backed RAM (BBR). The BBR contains clock data, latest position data (GNSS or bit data) and module configuration. But it is not meant for permanent data storage.

As the battery retains clock and last position, time to first fix (TTFF) significantly reduces to 1s. This allows much faster position locks.

Without the battery the GPS always cold-start so the initial GPS lock takes more time. The battery is automatically charged when power is applied and maintains data for up to two weeks without power.

## ESP ##
5pcs ESP-WROOM-32 ESP32 ESP32S 2.4GHz WiFi Bluetooth Development Board Arduino

ESP32 is already integrated antenna and RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise amplifiers, filters, 

and power management module. The entire solution takes up the least amount of printed circuit board area.
This board is used with 2.4 GHz dual-mode Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips by TSMC 40nm low power technology,
power and RF properties best, which is safe, reliable, and scalable to a variety of applications.

Features:

High performance-price ratio
Small volume, easily embeded to other products
Strong function with support LWIP protocol, Freertos
Supporting three modes: AP, STA, and AP+STA
Supporting Lua program, easily to develop
Development Board: https://github.com/Nicholas3388/LuaNode 


![Alt text](./README_img/ESP32_dimension.png)

https://circuits4you.com/2018/12/31/esp32-hardware-serial2-example/

There are three serial ports on the ESP32 known as U0UXD, U1UXD and U2UXD all work at 3.3V TTL Level. There are three hardware supported serial interfaces on the ESP32 known as UART0, UART1 and UART2. 


![Alt text](./README_img/ESP32-Pinout.jpg)

```/*
 * There are three serial ports on the ESP known as U0UXD, U1UXD and U2UXD.
 * 
 * U0UXD is used to communicate with the ESP32 for programming and during reset/boot.
 * U1UXD is unused and can be used for your projects. Some boards use this port for SPI Flash access though
 * U2UXD is unused and can be used for your projects.
 * 
*/
 
#define RXD2 16
#define TXD2 17
 
void setup() {
  // Note the format for setting a serial port is as follows: Serial2.begin(baud-rate, protocol, RX pin, TX pin);
  Serial.begin(115200);
  //Serial1.begin(9600, SERIAL_8N1, RXD2, TXD2);
  Serial2.begin(9600, SERIAL_8N1, RXD2, TXD2);
  Serial.println("Serial Txd is on pin: "+String(TX));
  Serial.println("Serial Rxd is on pin: "+String(RX));
}
 
void loop() { //Choose Serial1 or Serial2 as required
  while (Serial2.available()) {
    Serial.print(char(Serial2.read()));
  }
} 
```

This program reads data from serial2 and sends to serial0 i.e. programming serial. Multiple serial is useful when using GPS and GSM systems together.

The video on this site shows how use 3 serial connections on an esp32 board.
https://hackaday.com/2017/08/17/secret-serial-port-for-arduinoesp32/

This would allow a progamming connection, and GPS connection and a telescope connection.

Put the GPS on the 'secret one' so we can check it works. Pretty confident serial 2 will work - connect that to telescope lead.

## Software serial ##
I don't know whether the hardware serial is neccessary. The comment at the top
> **Also 5SE has TX and RX pins shortcutted so relatively weird logic with two software serial instances (one for TX, another for RX) is used to allow telescope firmware to work properly.**

suggests that splitting send and receive is neccessary?

``` #define RX_PIN 3
#define TX_PIN 5

ross mountserial(RX_PIN);
soss sendmountserial(TX_PIN);
```

Probably better start with software serial.
